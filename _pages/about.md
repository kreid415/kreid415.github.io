Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a Masters student at Johns Hopkins Bioinformatics program and a research engineer at Johns Hopkins University. My work is supported across a number of labs ranging from [computational epidemiology](https://pearlhivmodel.org/contact.html#kendall-reid) to biostatistics and neuroscience.

My personal research focuses on applying machine learning to genomic data. I'm interested in the following questions:

1. How do we effectively integrate omics data across modalities and experiments?

2. How do we learn patterns from omics data to model cellular states?

3. How do we model cellular perturbations and how can we correct cellular trajectories to avoid disease?
