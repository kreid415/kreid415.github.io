Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a Masters student at Johns Hopkins Bioinformatics program and an engineer within the [PEARL](https://pearlhivmodel.org/index.html) lab where I work with an amazing team of epidemiologists and public health scientists to model HIV populations based on Agent Based Simulations.

I'm an aspiring neurogenomic scientist interested in the multi-omic study of the brain and genome.

Research interests:

- Neuroimaging
- Genomics
- Connectomics
- Computational Drug Discovery
- Neuroinformatics
- Artifical Intelligence
