Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a Masters student at Johns Hopkins Bioinformatics program and an engineer within the [PEARL](https://pearlhivmodel.org/index.html) lab where I work with an amazing team of epidemiologists and public health scientists to model HIV populations based on Agent Based Simulations.

I'm an aspiring neuroinformatician and I hope to apply my bioinformatics background to neuroscience research. I'm intersted in the following problems at the intersection of Big Data and Neuroscience:

1. How do we store the massive amount of data that is generated by modern neuroimaging studies and neuroscience experiments?
2. How do we develop algorithms that can efficiently analyze this huge amount of data?
3. How can we apply findings in the clinical setting to better patient care?
