Hi, welcome to my website. I'm a Masters student at Johns Hopkins Bioinformatics program and an engineer within the [PEARL](https://pearlhivmodel.org/index.html) lab where I work with an amazing team of epidemiologists and public health scientists to model HIV populations based on Agent Based Simulations.

I've been lucky in my life to have experienced a number of different professions, and academic disciplines. I studied mathematics and economics as an undergraduate, computer science, biology, and chemistry as a post baccalaureate, and now bioinformatics as a masters student. During my studies, I've been a data scientist, founded a company as a machine learning engineer, and run clinical trials as a medical researcher.

With my varied background, I hope to have a unique perspective on the problems facing healthcare and the health sciences. I am an aspiring scientist, with broad interests across computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence.

I hope that this site can serve as a guide for those that wish to follow the path that I am on, as well as a place to share ideas and learn from one other. Read posts from my [blog](/blog), review my [publications](/publications), check out the [repositories](/repositories) that I contribute to, follow my [projects](/projects), or learn about the [people](/people) that have helped me get to where I am today.
